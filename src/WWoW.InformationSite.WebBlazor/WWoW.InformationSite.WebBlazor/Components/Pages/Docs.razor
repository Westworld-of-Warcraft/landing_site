                    <p>
                        Westworld of Warcraft (WWoW) is an ambitious project that transforms a World of Warcraft-like server 
                        into a living world populated by both real players and AI-driven bots. Our advanced AI agents operate 
                        independently, learn from their experiences, and create dynamic, emergent gameplay experiences.
                    </p>
